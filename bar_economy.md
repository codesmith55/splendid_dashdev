BAR ECONOMY::::: More or less strategy and role independent. These eco rules are generally in order of importance. To get good at bar you want to spend most of your attention on the front, and then you look at your metal and energy bars, and make the following economic "course corrections". Select a worker (that probably has been told to make infinite winds), and spacebar make a correction below (add a solar, con turret, or e storage), then go back to micro'ing the front.
Metal + Energy = Build Power(con turrets or workers)
Metal + No Energy = Basic solar
Default: Low Metal + Low Energy = Wind
Metal + Energy = Energy_Storage
No Metal + Energy_Storage + Energy = Reclaim solar
No Metal + Energy_Storage + Energy + No Solars = Energy_Converters

Metal + Energy = Build Power(con turrets or workers)
- # we have metal and energy, we want the upgear our economy for future flexibility

Metal + No Energy = Basic solar
#  We have metal that we can't spend, so solar spends it to get more E, fastest EROI

Default: Low Metal + Low Energy = Wind

# (assuming wind map, 0-16 like glitters or better)

Metal + Energy = Energy_Storage
# Good to have 1, fit in to about 1:4 Estorage/con turret, with your first after the 2nd con turret give or take

No Metal + Energy_Storage + Energy = Reclaim solar

No Metal + Energy_Storage + Energy + No Solars = Energy_Converters
# We are through the energy stall, we don't need EROI we need EPM, so we reclaim getting 100% of the initial resources(all M reclaimed), and convert into more efficient E/M now that we have E. # If we are still out of metal and have too much E, gratz, we start converters to bleed off anything past our Estorage

Metal + E storage + Energy = Adv Solar
# Really only exists for different maps and the apm starved. It is always wrong metal + energy wise to build advanced solar on a windmap, but it was 2 apm vs 20 for wind, so inefficient is not always wrong, just not the fastest
# The real 100% serious usecase for advanced solars on glitters is, "I have lots of metal, I have lots of energy(team overflowing Energy), I don't want to build more Build power, wind is currently low, I want to scale up safe energy and I forgot how to make energy storages or just don't want to think about it
